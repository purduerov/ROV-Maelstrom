/* Blue Robotics Arduino I2C ESC Control Library
------------------------------------------------
 
Title: Arduino I2C ESC Library

Description: This library provide methods to control I2C capable ESCs
using the Blue Robotics fork of the tgy firmware. It's designed for the
"BlueESC" but will work with an tgy compatible ESC.

The code is designed for the Arduino boards and can be compiled and 
uploaded via the Arduino 1.0+ software.
