# X8-BattleStation #
BattleStation code! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/purduerov/X8-BattleStation.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/purduerov/X8-BattleStation)  

The BattleStation uses Qt5.5. Please check the [wiki](http://rovwiki.pieee.org/doku.php?id=software:battlestation) for more information.

## Workflow ##
* Check the [milestones](https://github.com/purduerov/X8-BattleStation/milestones) for the current sprint and issues to be worked on.
* Issues marked with ``todo`` need to be assigned and worked on by somebody. When assigned change the label to ``in-progress`` to show that someone is working on it.
* Use a branch to work on your issue. Frequent commits to your branch are okay.
* When the task is done, create a pull request to merge your branch back in. [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/purduerov/X8-BattleStation) will attempt to build the branch and past system checks.
* If the branch passes, make sure to indicate in the pull requeset body that it closes or fixes issue ## [as explained here](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests)
* **Matt will merge in the pull request if everything looks good.** The branch made to work on this commit will then be deleted.
* If there's still issues labeled ``todo`` you can assign yourself and work on those, otherwise we will create and assign new issues in the next sprint. 

**Extra note**: [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/purduerov/X8-BattleStation) will give a nice overview of what is being worked on and things needed to be done.
