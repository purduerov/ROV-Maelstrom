# Maelstrom BattleStation #
ROV Maelstrom is controlled through Proven Roboticsâ€™ customized BattleStation software. The BattleStation is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) connected to ROV Maelstrom that displays practical information to the pilot. Sensor and system data are constantly relayed to the BattleStation from ROV Maelstrom and presented in various graphs. The simple displays let the pilot make decisions quickly. Additionally, the BattleStation has a timer and task list to assist with mission completion. The BattleStation was written in C++ with the Qt Framework. Qt provides an application framework that made construction of advanced graphical interfaces and customizations easy. These customizations make the interface both user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, Qt comes with libraries that have been well tested and with support for low level features, such as UDP and serial communication. C++ gives Proven Robotics the ability to use many other frameworks and libraries, such as SDL, which is used to interface with the Xbox controller.

The BattleStation uses Qt5.5. Please check the [wiki](http://rovwiki.pieee.org/doku.php?id=software:battlestation) for more information.
