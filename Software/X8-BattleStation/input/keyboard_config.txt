#SYNTAX:
ACTION = KEYBOARD CHARACTER

For example:

    TOGGLE_LEFT_CAMERA = X

#SPECIAL CHARACTERS:
f1 to f12 = f# (for example f1 is f1)
Shift = SHIFT
Caps Lock = CAPSLOCK
Backspace = BACKSPACE
Space Bar = SPACE
ESC = ESCAPE
Tab = TAB

#MULTIPLE KEYS AT THE SAME TIME:
"+" means that you have to hold the two keys at the same time.

For example:

    TOGGLE_LEFT_CAMERA = SHIFT+X

For example, setting something to SHIFT+A means you have to hold down SHIFT and A to activate it.
You can make as many combinations as possible, but I don't recommend more than two.
