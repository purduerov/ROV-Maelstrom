# PCB-Libraries
Contains all of our part libraries for our PCBs

ROV boards should only use parts from this library. If you need a part that is not here feel free
to fork the repository, make it, and then submit a pull request for it to be added. 

This repository is still currently being reviewed and the libraries are being consolidated.  

Make sure you branch, make changes in your branch by committing, and then pull request back in to merge your changes.
