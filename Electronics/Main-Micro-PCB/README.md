# PCB-Maelstrom-Main-Micro

The Main Microcontroller Board is ROV Maelstrom’s central processing unit, utilizing a STM32F4 microcontroller chip. The Main Microcontroller Board’s primary role is that of a gateway, translating between the different communication protocols and delivering information to the connected components. The microcontroller communicates data with the BattleStation via an onboard bridge that converts UDP and UART data between the Ethernet tether and microcontroller's I/O. The IMU, Temperature Sensor, and pressure sensor are able to communicate reliably with the Main Microcontroller Board via I2C, a protocol designed for communication between several nodes. It also controls the servo for the Main Camera over Pulse Position Modulation. The Power Distribution Board and the Application Board both talk to the Main Microcontroller Board via the CAN bus, a network designed for easy communication between several nodes with priority messaging. The CAN bus and software features of the Main Microcontroller Board are further explained in the software portion of the github.
