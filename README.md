# ROV-Maelstrom

Purdue IEEE designed an ROV (Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle) to compete in the 2016 [MATE international competition](http://www.marinetech.org/rov-competition-2/). ROV *Maelstrom* was the cumulation of this effort that resulted in a 13th place finish. For more information visit [purdueieee.org/rov](http://purdueieee.org/rov).

Our design is hearby open-sourced in order to share what we have done with other MATE teams and for any who are interested. While not all of our designs worked as planned, we share these files in order to assist thoughs who may need it and inspire others with these ideas.
