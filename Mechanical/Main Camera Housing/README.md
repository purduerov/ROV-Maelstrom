# Main Camera Housing 

The Camera housing is made from a polycarbonate tube and two aluminum endcaps. The camera is mounted onto a servo in the middle of the tube, and the servo is attached by a dowel to the endcap. This allows the camera to spin and gives the pilot a 180 degree field a view. The endcaps are sealed with two x-profile o-rings. 

For the cameras themselves we used IP addressable cameras for ROV Maelstrom. The signals from these cameras were then passed to an Ethernet switch. This switch then handled figuring out what information needed to be sent to the surface.
