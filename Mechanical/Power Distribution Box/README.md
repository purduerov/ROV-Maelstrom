# Power Distribution Box 

The Power Distribution Box contains the Power Distribution Board (see Electronics Design Rationale). The Power Distribution Box also controls ROV Maelstrom’s eight thrusters and hydraulic pump. Nine 16- mm Samtec connectors are used as channels to the thrusters and hydraulic pump. Additionally, a 16-mm Samtec connector transfers data and power from the Power Distribution Box to the Electronics tube. The Power Distribution Box is made of 0.3175 cm and 0.635 cm thick welded aluminum plates and is sealed with a 0.635 cm polycarbonate lid. ROV Maelstrom’s aluminum construction provides ample strength to sustain depths beyond the required 13 meters. The polycarbonate window provides a quick view into the electrical interior, enabling visual inspection of the Power Distribution Board and for signs of leakage. Moreover, the Power Distribution Box is designed to act as a structural element of ROV Maelstrom’s frame. This “double-duty” reduces the vehicle’s structural weight. The Power Distribution Box was mounted to the frame with the window facing the bottom of the ROV. This orientation creates a diving bell effect within the power box, so that in event of a failed face seal, the backwards air pressure reduces the likelihood of the water flooding upwards into the box. Additionally, if any small leaks cause some water to enter box, the dive bell shape prevent the electrical boards from immediate exposure to the water.
