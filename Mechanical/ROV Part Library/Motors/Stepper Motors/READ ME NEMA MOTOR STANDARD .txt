NEMA Motor Standard

There is no NEMA motor naming convention due to the fact that all NEMA Motor Sizes 
are controlled with Configurations.  Therefore there is absolutely no need to add 
any new files to this folder.

If you need a NEMA Stepper Motor Size and you do not know what a configuration is or 
how to use them, please contact the Mechanical Team Lead
