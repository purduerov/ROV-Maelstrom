# Wellhead

The wellhead tool has four grooves in it to position bolts so that they can be installed in one attempt. It requires that a person positions the bolts in the tool by hand. The tool will then clamp down on them. The ROV then moves over the wellhead and aligns the bolts. When the tool releases the bolts, then all drop into place in their correct positions.
