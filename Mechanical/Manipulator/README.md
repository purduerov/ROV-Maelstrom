# Manipulator

The manipulator is driven from a hydraulic piston attached to a base. There are three fingers attached to the base, with two on the top and one on the bottom. The design is optimized to pick up pipes, the most common prop in the competition.  The tips on the claw are 3D printed, allowing for several designs to be made, and quick changes between the two tips.
