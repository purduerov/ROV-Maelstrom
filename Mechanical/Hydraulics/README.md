# Hydraulics

The hydraulic system had an open loop design, and pulled in pool water, pressurized it, and sent it to a solenoid. The water was distributed by the solenoid and used to actuate the main claw, ESP tool, Wellhead tool, and other manipulators. After being used, it returned to the pool water. We used an M100 waterproof motor to power the pump. The solenoid was in an open faced housing, and filled with Magic Gel, a potting substance that sets to the consistency of gelatin. The Magic Gel insulated and water proofed the solenoid. While effective, it is permanent and needs to be removed before working on it and reapplied. We used a hydraulic system instead of electric motors for direct actuation to make waterproofing the system easier. Due to electrical issues the full system was never operated on the vehicle.
