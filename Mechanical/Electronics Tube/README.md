# Electronics Tube 

The purpose of the electronics tube is to house the Main Electronics. This year's electronics tube was based off of 2015 ROV Cerulean's design, with a few crucial improvements. The enclosure was designed as a cylinder, due to the inherent strength of the shape under pressure. The Electronics Tube is made of polycarbonate, with a machined aluminum coupling epoxied to each end. The couplings prevent the large diameter tube from flexing and provide a constant sealing surface for the end cap o-rings. The end caps house the o-ring grooves and provide a mounting surface for the electronic system backplane. Both end caps have two gland seals as well as a face seal, which provides several redundancies in case any single seal fails. The front end cap contains all outside connectors, while the rear end cap has no connectors, allowing easy access the electronic system without removing any cables. Each end cap and coupling was machined in-house, using CNC machines and machine code generated in CATIA, with manual turning performed on lathes. Given the immense cost of last yearâ€™s tube machining when contracting out a machine shop, it was decided to machine in-house, at a lower material cost, but with a high personal time commitment. However, the higher person hours was justified due to the company rapidly expanding, thus providing more employees for work on projects like these.
